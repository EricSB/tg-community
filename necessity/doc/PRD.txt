This is a C library for a string implementation that has a header
tag that contains the length.

The TaggedString is an implementation of a C string that will have:
0. 100% compatibility with normal C compilers.
1. memory management built in via NewTagStr and DelTagStr
2. the ability to pass a char * directly to other functions (i.e. printf)
3. the ability to concat 2 TaggedStrings together, non destructively
   with the new TaggedString being returned to the user.  ConCatTagStr().

TODO:

Datastructures
- Hashtable 
  - make it resize if max list depth is too long

- Tree
  - scapegoat tree

- Graph implementation 
  - box and pointer
  - adjacency list
  - adjacency matrix
  - conversions between the types

- List
  - map
  - filter
  - accumulate
  - GetElement(L, n) -gets the nth element
  - RemoveElementL, (n) -removes and returns the nth element
  - pop()
    (removal of RemoveElement(L, GetListSize(L)) in the list always)
	- this changes when we change ListIns
  - deque
    (removal of RemoveElement(L, 1) first element in the list alawys)
	- this changes when we change ListIns

- SkipList
  - implementation

stuff to do:
construct/traverse data structures
do system routines
distill large data sets to single values
transform one data set to another
