This is a C library for a string implementation that has a header
tag that contains the length.

The TaggedString is an implementation of a C string that will have:
0. 100% compatibility with normal C compilers.
1. memory management built in via NewTagStr and DelTagStr
2. the ability to pass a char * directly to other functions (i.e. printf)
3. the ability to concat 2 TaggedStrings together, non destructively
   with the new TaggedString being returned to the user.  ConCatTagStr().

TODO:

Sorts:
(are there any in std c lib?)
- merge sort
- quick sort

Memoized Maths:
n-choose-k function 
- ship the lib with a database of these things, if we have to save the
  memoised hash table to the disk then so be it.

Datastructures
- hashtable with arrays
- Copy the avl tree into here so it can work seperately
- need a nary tree 
- trie-tries(?)
- probablistic data structures  

locks
- mutex, semaphore

stuff to do:
construct/traverse data structures
do system routines
distill large data sets to single values
transform one data set to another

Graphs:
we want 3 types of graphs:
- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list
- Objects and ptrs
