This is a C library for a string implementation that has a header
tag that contains the length.

The TaggedString is an implementation of a C string that will have:
0. 100% compatibility with normal C compilers.
1. memory management built in via NewTagStr and DelTagStr
2. the ability to pass a char * directly to other functions (i.e. printf)
3. the ability to concat 2 TaggedStrings together, non destructively
   with the new TaggedString being returned to the user.  ConCatTagStr().
