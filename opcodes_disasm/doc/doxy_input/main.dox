\mainpage Opdis : Opcode Disassembler

\section overview Overview

<P>
Opdis is a wrapper for the libopcodes disassembler library distributed as part
of GNU binutils. It extends the libopcodes library by offering linear and
control-flow disassembly algorithms, instruction and operand objects that
are suitable for analysis, and a command-line utility to perform disassembly 
on arbitrary locations in a file.
</P>

<P>
These features are lacking in libopcodes and objdump. The design of libopcodes
makes it awkward to use for binary analysis; it assumes that disassembled
instructions are going to be printed, not stored or analyzed, and therefore
it invokes a callback with an fprintf(3) signature. The shortcomings of objdump
are even greater: it does not support control-flow disassembly, nor does it
allow the user to specify which bytes in the file to disassemble.
</P>

<P>
The Opdis project consists of the \ref sec_libopdis library and the 
\ref sec_opdis command-line utility.

\section sec_libopdis libopdis

<P>
The libopdis library contains the core functionality; it uses linear and
control-flow algorithms to generate instruction and operand objects.

\section sec_opdis opdis

<P>
The opdis utility is a command-line front-end to the library which attempts to
meet the needs of a generic disassembler.
</P>

\section sec_supported_arch Supported Architectures

<P>
Opdis supports the disassembly of all architectures that libopcodes supports.
On most of these architectures, however, only the ASCII string for the
disassembled instruction is available.
</P>

<P>
Complete instruction and operand objects are generated only for the following
platforms:
	- x86
	- x86-64
</P>
